# Pre-commit Git Hook
#
# This hook is executed automatically before a commit is created.
# It runs smoke tests to ensure basic functionality is working correctly
# before allowing the commit to proceed.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Validates code integrity by running smoke tests
#   - Prevents commits if critical tests fail
#   - Ensures code quality and basic functionality
#
# Requirements:
#   - bats (Bash Automated Testing System) must be installed
#   - tests/smoke-test.bats must exist in the project root
#
# Exit codes:
#   - 0: All tests passed, commit will proceed
#   - Non-zero: Tests failed, commit will be aborted
#
# Usage:
#   This hook is automatically triggered by git commit
#   To bypass this hook (not recommended): git commit --no-verify
